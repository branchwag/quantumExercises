Some lingo that may be useful!

1. Bell State
A Bell state in quantum computing is a special type of entangled state where two qubits are linked such that the state of one qubit instantly influences the state of the other, no matter the distance between them.

2. Superposition
The principle that a qubit can exist in multiple states (0 and 1) simultaneously, rather than being in a single state like a classical bit.

3. Hadamard Gate
A basic operation that transforms a qubit into an equal superposition of its 0 and 1 states, creating a state where the qubit has a 50% chance of being measured as 0 and a 50% chance of being measured as 1.

4. The CNOT (Controlled NOT) GateA two-qubit operation where the state of the second qubit (target) is flipped if the first qubit (control) is in the state 1, otherwise, the target qubit remains unchanged.

5. Pauli Operators
A set of three basic matrices (Pauli-X, Pauli-Y, and Pauli-Z) used to describe quantum gates that can change the state of a qubit by flipping its state, rotating it, or inverting its phase.

In quantum computing, operators like ZZ, XX, and YY perform specific transformations on qubit states, altering their properties such as phase, amplitude, or entanglement.
